# Testing the `has_trivial_storage` functionality of Linera.

The has trivial storage function needs to be tested. Here we do
so by using two contracts. The contracts are created, and run.

The test is run as:

```bash
# Run the test
./run_test.sh
```

It does create some contracts and then tests the behavior.
